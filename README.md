This repository is for my website: https://newer.systems

It is created using hugo, a lightweight static sight generator
written in go. I use it to share my portfolio, sell scores, and
provide updates on various projects. It is updated fairly often
and there are a number of rss feeds available to keep up with my
projects and compositions. Eventually, I plan to host a blog
focusing on audio and composition work with various open-source
and linux-friendly tools.
