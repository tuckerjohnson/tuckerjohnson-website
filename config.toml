  description = """### Tucker Johnson, short bio

  Currently based in Rochester, New York, Tucker Johnsonâ€™s
  musical practice includes works for soloists, ensembles,
  and electronic media. He seeks to draw connections
  between philosophy, mathematics, and design through his
  work. These ideas are often synthesized through a blend
  of experimentation and highly organized systems.
  Experiences reading, hiking, and amateur botanizing can
  be found intertwined in his work, alongside interests in

  open-source software and teaching."""
