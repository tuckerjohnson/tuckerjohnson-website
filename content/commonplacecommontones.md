sinfonietta - 6 minutes

completed Fall 2021

#### {{< bluer words="program notes" >}}
{{< greener words="Commonplace Common Tones" >}} explores relationships between overlapping groups, or groups which share elements. These relationships are present as subdivisions of the ensemble, collections of pitches, and rhythmic patterns. The piece contains 3 ‘kinds’ of music. The first is scattered in nature—utilizing varieties of sparse instrumental combinations, the second is chordal, and the third is driving and rhythmic. These are arranged across 6 sections each using a different combination of 2 overlapping pitch collections. I originally came up with the title {{< greener words="Commonplace Common Tones" >}} in reference to an isomorphism between common tones in collections of pitches and common places in rhythmic patterns, but it could also refer to the diatonic familiarity of the pitch collections themselves, or to the communality of ensemble music.
