open ensemble - variable

completed Fall 2020

#### {{< bluer words="program notes" >}}
The foundation for {{< greener words="moment / time -Practice" >}} are the six phrases: for only a moment, for only a breath, for beyond a breath, for only your mind, for only your body, for beyond you.

Even when things seem still, they are changing. Imagine for a moment the temporality of plate tectonics or the forming and moving of glaciers. These temporalities are vast compared to our breath, the primary measurement of the moment. Dogen Zenji, the 11th-century Buddhist thinker, describes a practice of connecting the moment through meditation, imagining boundless creativity. {{< greener words="moment / time - Practice" >}} hopes to connect us with not just time but also place.
