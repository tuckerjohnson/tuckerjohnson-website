completed Fall 2021

#### {{< yelr words="program notes" >}}
{{< greener words="Mutable Subjects" >}} was commissioned by percussionist Michael Standard.\
{{< greener words="Mutable Subjects" >}}is a work performed entirely from a custom supercollider program.
The piece begins with the presentation of two pitch collections, one by the human performer, and one by the computer.
Properties of the relationship between these collections are used by the supercollider program to structure improvisation into discreet sections in the piece. It is highly unlikely that any two performances of this work will share the same structure.
The human and the virtual marimba player do not share the same access to this structure, as the human player has to interpret the same kinds of material the virtual performer feels.
