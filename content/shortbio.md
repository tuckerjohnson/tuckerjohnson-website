\#\#\# {{< violr words="Tucker Johnson, short bio" >}}

Currently based in Rochester, New York, Tucker Johnson's\
musical practice includes works for soloists, ensembles,\
and electronic media. He seeks to draw connections\
between philosophy, mathematics, and design through his\
work. These ideas are often synthesized through a blend\
of experimentation and highly organized systems.\
Experiences reading, hiking, and amateur botanizing can\
be found intertwined in his work, alongside interests in\
visual art, open-source software, and teaching.
