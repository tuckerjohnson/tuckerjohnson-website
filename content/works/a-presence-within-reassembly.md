This work for quadrophonic playback is based on my practice as a bassoonist and improviser. I have always been interested in delicate and unusual sounds, often taking the bassoon apart mid-performance to achieve the desired sound. Rimsky- Korsakov lays out in the introduction to Principles of Orchestration that "orchestration is part of the very soul of the work. A work is thought out in terms of the orchestra..." In this work, I posit the not so new idea of the bassoon as sculpture or architecture; a work of art crafted by a history of performance practice and an ever specializing role. {{< greener words="A Presence Within Reassembly" >}} is thought out in terms of bassoon, but the sign is empty, reorganized around a new soul: the soul present in this assembly.
