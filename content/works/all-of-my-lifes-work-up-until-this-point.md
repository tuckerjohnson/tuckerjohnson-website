#### {{< yelr words="program notes" >}}
My ideal experience within my practice—whether it be composition, improvisation or anything else—is an organized
exploration. The path is detailed. It allows me to consider as many possibilities and reflect on my decisions.
Sometimes my exploration allows me to arrive at the same place I started; a feeling of satisfaction and an object as I
intended it. Arriving at an unintended or new location is even better; my practice yields something exciting and
challenging. A knight’s tour is the path by which a knight reaches every position on a chess board utilizing only it’s
defined moves. Many possible knight’s tours are radically symmetrical—this work for cello is modeled after one such
tour.
