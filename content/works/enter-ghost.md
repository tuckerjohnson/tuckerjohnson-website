-Enter Ghost- (trombone)\
Marcellus: "Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!" (trumpet)\
Bernardo: "In the same figure, like the king that's dead." (bass clarinet)\
Marcellus: "Thou art a scholar; speak to it *Horatio."\
Bernardo: "Looks it not like the king? Mark it *Horatio."\
Horatio: "Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder." (voice)\
Bernardo: "It would be spoke to."\
Marcellus: "Question it *Horatio."\
Horatio: "What art thou? What art thou that usurp'st this time of night? Thou that usurp'st this time of night together with that fair and war-like form in which the Majesty of buried Denmark did sometime march. By heaven, what art though? By heaven, by heaven I charge thee. I charge thee speak!"\
Marcellus: "It is offended."\
Bernardo: "See, it stalks away!"\
Horatio: "Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!"\
-Exit Ghost-

> *Marcellus*: "What, ha's this thing appear'd againe tonight?" Then: *Enter the Ghost, Exit the Ghost, Enter the Ghost, as before*. A question of repetition: a spectre is always a *revenant*. One cannot control its comings and goings because it *begins by coming back*. [...] What seems almost impossible is to speak always *of the* specter, to speak *to the* the specter, to speak with it, therefore especially *to make or to let a spirit speak*. And the thing seems even more difficult for a reader, an expert, a professor, an interpreter, in short, for what Marcellus calls a "scholar." (Derrida, Specters of Marx)

Originally composed for loadbang, {{< greener words="Enter Ghost" >}} sets an adapted scene from the first act of Hamlet. The performers are cast as the four roles: voice as Horatio, trumpet as Marcellus, bass clarinet as Bernardo, and trombone as the ghost. The 'music' is an extension of the theatrical elements of the text, an extension of physical aspects of acting such as blocking.
