At the start of 2022, I composed a short piece for piano constructed from descending
diatonic scales and the 15 partitions of the integer 7. This invention
would inspire me to write 14 more inventions. These {{< greener words="Fifteen Inventions" >}}
correspond to one of the 15 partitions and, as such, have between 1 and 7 strands or
voices. Inventions with the same number of strands or voices share titles and musical
characters. I borrowed terms from plant morphology I felt describe these musical
characters for the titles. Pappus is the fluffy hair-like material which carries
seeds through the air, Panicle is an inflorescence with many branches thrusting out
in different directions, and Pinnate describes a two-rowed leaflet structure.

{{< greener words="Fifteen Keyboard Inventions Inventions" >}} will receive it's premeire in Fall 2022.
