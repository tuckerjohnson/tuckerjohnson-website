{{< violr words="tabla, percussion quartet - 8 minutes" >}}

completed Summer 2018

#### {{< yelr words="program notes" >}}
Composed in 2018 for the SHASTRA Rhythm Workshop, {{< greener words="...for the discernment of vocations..." >}} deals with the iterative improvisation found in traditional tabla performance and iterative pitch transformations. The piece is in two sections: an introduction which is free rhythmically, and the rhtyhmic tabla improvisation. The tabla's improvisation is broken up by contrapuntal episodes in the mallet percussion.
