Anton Bruckner completed the Two Aequali in 1847 at the age of 22 for the funeral of his
great-aunt. At this point in his life, he was working at the St Florian Monastery. It is often
thought that these early works foreshadow the expressive and romantic harmonies of his mature
work. The second Aequale is missing its bass trombone part, which was never uncovered and is
typically performed with a reconstruction.

In December of 2020, John McGovern shared his arrangement of the first Aequale for
vibraphone with me, and I was immediately taken by it. After some research and discussion with
John, I proposed he arrange the second, leaving out its missing voice. What I proposed to take its
place was a reconstruction of the lost voice through temporal aliasing. In digital audio, when the
sample rate is too low, frequencies of half that sampling rate will be reconstructed as low
frequencies by the computer. The second Aequale is downsampled live, so this effect—which is
usually undesirable—creates new tones not actually present. I think of this presence as a
conjuring (or mis-conjuring) of Bruckner—*electroacoustic necromancy*.

This misappropriation of Bruckner has a historical precedent as well. Working for the
International Bruckner Society between 1935 and 1944, Robert Haas published editions of
several Bruckner symphonies and often reworked material such that it was unrecognizable from
the manuscript. These edits were in line with Haas’s vision of Bruckner as a pure and simple
country soul uncorrupted by “cosmopolitan and Jewish influences.” Haas was expelled from the
International Bruckner Society for his affiliation with the Nazi party.
