completed Fall 2018

#### {{< yelr words="program notes" >}}
{{< greener words="JetFuel" >}} was the first piece of mine to explore combinatoric compositional structures applied to the diatonic scale.
It is in two broad sections.
The first is a lopsided march constructed of overlapping musical cells of unequal length. The cells phase in and out and overlap to create an ever-changing yet consistent texture.
The second section is a brisk dance. Repeating musical cells hocket and interlock, highlighting an presenting the different intervals of the diatonic set.

{{< greener words="JetFuel" >}} was commissioned by William Weidrich and the Tampa Metropolitan Youth Orchestra
