{{< greener words="Settle the Score" >}} is a piece for five instruments: cor anglais, trumpet, electric guitar, violin, and computer. It can either be performed as a chamber work with all five parts, or any one part alone. The piece is designed so that each part has unique content and contour; each solo has different alternations of smooth and jagged music. When played as a chamber work, {{< greener words="Settle the Score" >}} reveals a sequence of forty-seven 12-tone aggregates, partitioned into all the five part aggregates with part sizes from one to twelve. All six versions are different, but they share a light spirit, and a comfortable whether alone or together.
