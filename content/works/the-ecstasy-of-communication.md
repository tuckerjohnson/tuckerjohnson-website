{{< greener words="The Ecstasy of Communication" >}} was commissioned by John McGovern for his DMA
recital on snare drum and text. It is inspired by an essay of the same name by Jean Baudrillard
published in 1987. It is in four acts: 2000(20) of Something, Reactionary Counterpoint, What The
Emperor Has, and How We(you and me) Maintain Our Orbit, each experimenting with a
different text/image notation.

commissioned by percussionist John McGovern
