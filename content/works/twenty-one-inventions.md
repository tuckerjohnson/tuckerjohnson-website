in progress

#### {{< yelr words="program notes" >}}
{{< greener words="Twenty-One Inventions" >}} is a modular, multi-movement work for piano. The inventions are organized into seven, three-movement groups called sequences. These sequences can be played in any combination. I constructed each of the short inventions from one to seven contrapuntal strands. Inventions which share the same number of these strands are composed out in a similar fashion, and thus share a title.

{{< greener words="Twenty-One Inventions" >}} will receive it's premeire in Fall 2022.
