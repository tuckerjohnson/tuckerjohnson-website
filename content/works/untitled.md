completed Spring 2019

#### {{< yelr words=“program notes” >}}
{{< greener words=“- - - - - - -“ >}} began as an installation created at the Nick Cave/Bob Faust collaborative workshop in Fall 2019. For the workshop, teams of artists from across the USF college of the arts collaborated to create performances, sculptures, and installations. Our team’s installation was built out of textiles, projected images, and sound. The playback version embraces an unusual structural proportion.
