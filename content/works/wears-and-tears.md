The ‘war machine’ in {{< greener words="Wears and Tears" >}} presents another future—the duet is between ours
and another. Not an alternate direction in time, but an alternate direction of psychological
perception and expectation. An alternate methodology. The effects and relationship of the
alternate are only there when we listen. When we are “hearing what is not there, the recorded
voice...Not phonocentrism but phonography, sound coming to occupy the dis- place of writing.”
(Mark Fisher) We are lucky, as it is easiest to hear in the most radically contracted space and
time—cyberspace. Here, hauntology latches to all culture as it is distributed and consumed.
“nothing here but us recordings...” (Mark Fisher)
