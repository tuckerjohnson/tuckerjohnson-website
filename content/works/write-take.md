The experience is most common—for me at least—in a public bathroom. Looking up after washing my
hands, I look into the eyes of not only myself but several others, fading continuously at a degree of
separation. Is it weird to stand and admire this infinite slide of face? If the angle is right, deaths may
literally be to my left: advice abounds. {{< greener words="WRITE/TAKE," >}} commissioned for soundSCAPE 2019, is a
composition for two guitars which explores self-similarity. Throughout the work, the guitars trade roles
at regular intervals, exploring repeating sets of pitch, timbre, and rhythm. The exchange is not a
dialogue. The perspective turns to face the opposing surface, and the guitars take turns reflecting
material back and forth at different levels.
